### Personal Blog - Project Documentation
Developed by Matheus Lopes.

This project is more of a website, a simple Personal Blog, showing information about the developer and the things he does/works with.

## Technologies used
   - TypeScript;
   - ReactJS;
   - Axios;
   - Material-UI (v4);

## Functionalities
The website has two main functionalities:
 - The homepage, where the viewer can read information and facts about the developer and;
 - The PokéAPI Card, inside the left-side drawer, where the user can click "Find Pokémon" to get a random Pokémon, with it's name and Pokedex number.

<sup>\* In case you want to find more about any Pokémon, check out the [Pokémon DataBase](https://https://pokemondb.net/).</sup>

## Installation and execution
To install the application, follow this simple 3-step guide:
   
1. First choose the folder where you want to install it;
2. Once you chose a folder, open a bash terminal and type the following commands:
   
   1. Clone the git repository:

      `git clone https://github.com/Ltheus/personal-blog.git`
   
   2. Access the application's directory: 

      `cd personal-blog`
   
   3. Installing **NodeJS**'s\* dependencies, using **npm**\**:

3. After running it, click the link that appears on the terminal (E.g.: "http://localhost:3000/").
 
 <sup>\* In case you don't have NodeJS installed, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and install the LTS release.</sup>

<sup>\*** If the installation doesn't work, add `--force` to the end of the third command. This is due to the releases of the libraries used on this project.</sup>
